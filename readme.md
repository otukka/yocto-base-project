# Introduction
Sample yocto layer project for Xilinx RFSoC. Basic conf files modified from meta-petalinux. Example application can be found in [Embedded-app](https://github.com/otukka/Embedded-app).

# Usage
Run the test file to test if everything works.
 >$ ./test.sh
This asks password at the end because it installs sdk to /opt/

# Note
All sublayers are not used. This is due to sample project. More refactoring is needed.
